Termlogic Documentation

We are in the process of moving Termlogic documentation from its current private repo to this public Github repo.

We expect to have the following documents out soon:

Developer's manual
User manual
Functional services manual
Other documentation like test reports and code quality metrics will also be made available.

Please get in touch with us if Termlogic sounds interesting and you'd like to know more. You can find a brief introduction at :
